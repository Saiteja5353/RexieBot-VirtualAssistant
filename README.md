# RexieBot-VirtualAssistant
"Rexie" is an advanced virtual assistant with a user-friendly graphical interface developed using Python and Tkinter. It leverages speech_recognition to understand and process voice commands, allowing users to interact hands-free. With pyttsx3, Rexie provides voice responses, making interactions more natural. The assistant can perform web searches and open YouTube videos using pywhatkit, and can set alarms and send WhatsApp messages with precise timing. Rexie can also read PDFs aloud, locate the user's position using requests and geopy, and execute calculations based on voice input. Additionally, it integrates functionalities for shutting down or restarting the system, opening and closing applications, and even telling jokes. The project seamlessly combines various libraries like wikipedia, pyjokes, and PyPDF2, creating a comprehensive virtual assistant experience.
